  <div>
    <h3>1791</h3>
    <p>Charles Babbage was born in London, England.</p>
    <h3>1810-1814</h3>
    <p>
      He went to Cambridge for College.<br />
      Specifically Trinity and Peterhouse where he would graduate there.
      <br />While he was there, he teamed up people like John Herschel and
      George Peacock. <br />
      He made a small calculator that can perform certain math equation up to
      eight decimals.
    </p>
    <h3>1823</h3>
    <p>
      He gained government support to make the "Difference Engine". <br />It
      had a decimal capacity up to 20 decimals and also does calculations like
      the small calculator that he had. <br />It was sort of like a computer.
      It had storage like a computer as well. Although it wasn't fully built.
    </p>
    <h3>Mid 1830s</h3>
    <p>
      Babbage made plans for the "Analytical Engine".<br />The forerunner for
      modern computers.<br />This was supposed to make automatic calculations
      from punched cards.
    </p>

    <h3>1843-1871</h3>
    <p>
      Ada Lovelace got translated a French paper and published how it could
      perform it's own calculations.<br />Although it was never made until a
      group a scientists made an accurate model according to the specs
      provided by Babbage in 1991. Babbage died in 1871.
